## Basic CSS  
`CSS`, or `Cascading Style Sheets`, tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. With CSS, you can control the `color`, `font`, `size`, `spacing`, and many other aspects of HTML elements.  
Now that you've described the structure of your cat photo app, give it some style with CSS.    
###  01. **Change the Color of Text**  
Now let's change the color of some of our text.  
We can do this by changing the `style` of your `h2` element.  
The property that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the `color` style property.  
Here's how you would set your `h2` element's text color to blue:  
```html
<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```  
Note that it is a good practice to end inline `style` declarations with a `;` .  
### 02. **Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements**  
With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS properties that you can use to change the way an element looks on your page.  
When you entered `<h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>`, you were styling that individual `h2` element with inline CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  
That's one way to specify the style of an element, but there's a better way to apply CSS.  
At the top of your code, create a style block like this:  
```html
<style>
</style>
```  
Inside that style block, you can create a `CSS selector` for all `h2` elements. For example, if you wanted all `h2` elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this:  
```html
<style>
    h2 {
        color: red;
    }
</style>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
```  
Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces (`{` and `}`) around each element's style rule(s). You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add a `semicolon(;)` to the end of each of your element's style rules.  
### 03. **Use a CSS Class to Style an Element**  
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.  
Here's an example CSS `class` declaration:  
```html
<style>
    .blue-text {
        color: blue;
    }
</style>

<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```  
You can see that we've created a CSS `class` called `blue-text` within the `<style>` tag. You can apply a `class` to an HTML element like this: `<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>`.  
Note that in your CSS `style` element, class names start with a `period(.)`. In your HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the `period`.  
### 04.**Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class**  
Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements. You can see this by applying your `red-text` class to the first `p` element.    
```html
<style>
    .red-text {
        color: red;
    }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a></p>
```  
### 05. **Change the Font Size of an Element**  
Font size is controlled by the `font-size` CSS property, like this:  
```html
<style>
    p {
        font-size: 16px;
    }
    .red-text {
        color: red;
    }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
```  
### 06. **Set the Font Family of an Element**  
You can set which font an element should use, by using the `font-family(字体)` property.  
For example, if you wanted to set your `h2` element's font to `sans-serif`, you would use the following CSS:  
```html
<style>
    h2 {
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }
</style>
```  
Here's detaied code.  
```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

  <h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
```  
### 07. **Import a Google Font**  
In addition to specifying common fonts that are found on most operating systems, we can also specify non-standard, custom web fonts for use on our website. There are many sources for web fonts on the Internet. For this example we will focus on the `Google Fonts library`.  
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a free library of web fonts that you can use in your CSS by referencing the font's URL.  
So, let's go ahead and import and apply a Google font (note that if Google is blocked in your country, you will need to skip this challenge).  

To `import` a Google Font, you can copy the font's URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your HTML. For this challenge, we'll import the `Lobster` font. To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor (before the opening `style` element):  
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```  
Now you can use the `Lobster` font in your CSS by using `Lobster` as the FAMILY_NAME as in the following example:  
```html
<style>
    p {        
        font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;
    }
</style>
```  
The GENERIC_NAME is `optional`, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is `not available`. This is covered in the next challenge.  

Family names are `case-sensitive` and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. For example, you need quotes to use the `"Open Sans"` font, but not to use the `Lobster` font.  
Here's detailed code.  
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
```  
### 08. **Specify How Fonts Should Degrade**  
There are several `default fonts` that are available in all browsers. These generic font families include `monospace`, `serif` and `sans-serif`.  
When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.  
For example, if you wanted an element to use the `Helvetica` font, but degrade to the `sans-serif` font when `Helvetica` isn't available, you will specify it as follows:  
```html
<style>
    p {        
        font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
    }
</style>
```  
Generic font family names are not case-sensitive. Also, they do not need quotes because they are CSS keywords.  

### 09. **Size Your Images**  
CSS has a property called `width` that controls an element's width. Just like with `fonts`, we'll use `px (pixels)` to specify the image's width.  
For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called `larger-image` that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use:   
```html
<style>
  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>

<a href="#" ><img class="smaller-image" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back." ></a>
```  
### 10. **Add Borders Around Your Elements**  
CSS `borders`(边框) have properties like `style`, `color` and `width`.  
For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:  
```html
<style>
  .thin-red-border {
    border-color: red;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>
```  
Create a class called `thick-green-border`. This class should add a 10px, solid, green border around an HTML element. Apply the class to your cat photo.  
```html
<style>
    .smaller-image {
        width: 100px;
  }
    .thick-green-border {
        border-width: 10px;
        border-color: green;
        border-style: solid;
  }
</style>

<a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>
```  
Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element using its `class` attribute, by separating each class name with a `space`. For example:  
```html
<img class="class1 class2">
```  
### 11. **Add Rounded Corners(圆角) with border-radius**  
Your cat photo currently has `sharp corners`. We can round out those corners with a CSS property called `border-radius`.  
You can specify a `border-radius` with pixels. Give your cat photo a `border-radius` of `10px`.  
```html
<style>
    .smaller-image {
        width: 100px;
  }
    .thick-green-border {
        border-width: 10px;
        border-color: green;
        border-style: solid;
        border-radius: 10px; 
  }
</style>

<a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>
```
Note: This challenge allows for multiple possible solutions. For example, you may add `border-radius` to either the `.thick-green-border` class or the `.smaller-image` class.  
### 12. **Make Circular Images with a border-radius**  
In addition to pixels, you can also specify the `border-radius` using a percentage(%).  
```html
<style>
    .smaller-image {
        width: 100px;
  }
    .thick-green-border {
        border-width: 10px;
        border-color: green;
        border-style: solid;
        border-radius: 50%; 
  }
</style>

<a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back."></a>
```  
### 13. **Give a Background Color to a div Element**  
You can set an element's background color with the `background-color` property.  
For example, if you wanted an element's background color to be `green`, you'd put this within your `style` element:  
```html
<style>
    .green-background {
        background-color: green;
}
</style>
<div class="green-background">
   ...
</div>
```  
### 14. **Set the id of an Element**  
In addition to `classes`, each HTML element can also have an `id` attribute.  
There are several benefits to using `id` attributes: You can use an `id` to style a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript.  
`id` attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice. So please don't give more than one element the same id attribute.  
Here's an example of how you give your `h2` element the id of `cat-photo-app`:  
```html
<h2 id="cat-photo-app"> ...</h2>
```  
### 15. **Use an id Attribute to Style an Element**  
One cool thing about `id` attributes is that, like classes, you can style them using CSS.  

However, an `id` is not reusable and should only be applied to one element. An `id` also has a `higher specificity` (importance) than a `class` so if both are applied to the same element and have conflicting styles, the styles of the `id` will be applied.  

Here's an example of how you can take your element with the `id` attribute of `cat-photo-element` and give it the background color of green. In your `style` element:  
```html
<style>
    #cat-photo-form {
        background-color: green;
    }
</style>
<form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo" id="cat-photo-form">
    ...
</form>
```  
Note that inside your `style` element, you always reference classes by putting a `.` in front of their names. You always reference ids by putting a `#` in front of their names.  
### 16. **Adjust the Padding of an Element**  
Now let's put our Cat Photo App away for a little while and learn more about styling HTML.    
You may have already noticed this, but all HTML elements are essentially little rectangles(矩形).  
Three important properties control the space that surrounds each HTML element: `padding`, `border`, and `margin`.

An element's `padding` controls the amount of space between the element's `content` and its `border`.  
Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has more `padding` than the blue box.  
When you increase the blue box's padding, it will increase the `distance` (padding) between the `text` and the `border` around it.  
```html
<style>
  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .box {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 0px;
  }

  .red-box {
    background-color: crimson;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
  }

  .blue-box {
    background-color: blue;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
  }
</style>
<h5 class="injected-text">margin</h5>

<div class="box yellow-box">
  <h5 class="box red-box">padding</h5>
  <h5 class="box blue-box">padding</h5>
</div>
```  
### 17. **Adjust the Margin of an Element**  
An element's `margin` controls the amount of space between an element's `border` and `surrounding elements`.  
Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has a bigger `margin` than the blue box, making it appear smaller.  
When you `increase` the blue box's margin, it will increase the `distance` between its `border` and `surrounding elements`.   
```html
<style>
  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .box {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 10px;
  }

  .red-box {
    background-color: crimson;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 20px;
  }

  .blue-box {
    background-color: blue;
    color: #fff;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 10px;
  }
</style>
<h5 class="injected-text">margin</h5>

<div class="box yellow-box">
  <h5 class="box red-box">padding</h5>
  <h5 class="box blue-box">padding</h5>
</div>
```  
### 18.**Add a Negative Margin to an Element**  
An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's `border` and `surrounding elements`.  
If you set an element's `margin` to a `negative value`, the element will grow `larger`.  
### 19. **Add Different Padding to Each Side of an Element**  
Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has different amounts of `padding` on each of its sides.  
CSS allows you to control the padding of all four individual sides of an element with the `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, and `padding-left` properties.  
```html
<style>
  .injected-text {
    margin-bottom: -25px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .box {
    border-style: solid;
    border-color: black;
    border-width: 5px;
    text-align: center;
  }

  .yellow-box {
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 10px;
  }

  .red-box {
    background-color: crimson;
    color: #fff;
    padding-top: 40px;
    padding-right: 20px;
    padding-bottom: 20px;
    padding-left: 40px;
  }

  .blue-box {
    background-color: blue;
    color: #fff;
    padding-top: 40px;
    padding-right: 20px;
    padding-bottom: 20px;
    padding-left: 40px;
  }
</style>
<h5 class="injected-text">margin</h5>

<div class="box yellow-box">
  <h5 class="box red-box">padding</h5>
  <h5 class="box blue-box">padding</h5>
</div>
```  
### 20. **Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Padding of an Element**  
Instead of specifying an element's `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, and `padding-left` properties individually, you can specify them all in one line, like this:`padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px`;  
These four values work like a `clock: top, right, bottom, left,` and will produce the exact same result as using the side-specific padding instructions.  
### 21. **Use Attribute Selectors to Style Elements**  
You have been adding `id` or `class` attributes to elements that you wish to specifically style. These are known as ID and class selectors. There are other CSS Selectors you can use to select custom groups of elements to style.  
Let's bring out CatPhotoApp again to practice using CSS Selectors.  
For this challenge, you will use the `[attr=value]` attribute selector to style the checkboxes in CatPhotoApp. This selector matches and styles elements with a specific attribute value. For example, the below code changes the margins of all elements with the attribute `type` and a corresponding value of `radio`:  
```html
<style>
    [type='radio'] {
        margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;
    }
</style>
```
Here's detailed code.
```html
<style>
    [type='radio'] {
        margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;
    }
    [type="checkbox"] {
        margin: 10px 0px 15px 0px;
    }
</style>
<form action="https://freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo" id="cat-photo-form">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```  
### 22. **Understand Absolute versus Relative Units**
